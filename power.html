            <h1>Strengths</h1>
            My strenght in terms of IT industry, my familiarity with basic programming languages, and my capacity for quick
            learning are all to my advantage. I have experience building websites and am knowledgeable about the C++ and
            HTML computer languages.<br>

            <h1>Weaknesses</h1>
            My weakness in terms of IT industry, one of my weaknesses is memorizing variables, especially when the codes and 
            variables are significantly more complex than those in C++ and other programming languages. Additionally, 
            I'm hesitant to share my thoughts with others for fear that they would criticize.<br>
